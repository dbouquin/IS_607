Practicing data clean-up and transformations using `tidyr` and `dplyr`. CRAN documentation available for `tidyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) and `dplr` documentation can be found [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

![This chart describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/105967710/IS607_img1_HW5%20copy.png)

1. Create a CSV file that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations:

```{r}
# Create a dataframe that contains the data pictured above:
hw5data <- data.frame(
  airline = rep(c('Alaska', 'AMWest'), each = 2),
  status = c('on-time', 'delayed', 'on-time', 'delayed'),
  LosAngeles = c(497,62,694,117),
  Phoenix = c(221,12,4840,415),
  SanDiego = c(212,20,383,65),
  SanFrancisco = c(503,102,320,129),
  Seattle = c(1841,305,201,61)
)

# Write the data to a CSV and save it to current working directory
write.csv(hw5data, "IS607_HW5_data.csv")

```

2. Read the information from your CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.  

```{r}
data <- read.csv("IS607_HW5_data.csv") # Reads in the CSV file

str(data) # check out the structure
data <- data[,2:7] # remove ID column (X)

data 

```

3. Restructure the data into a more useful format:

```{r}
tidy_data <- data %>%
  gather(city, count, -airline, -status) # Convert the data into a long format using gather() from tidyr package

tidy_data 

```

3. Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

```{r}

# Calculate total number of flights for each airline using aggregate():
total_flights <- aggregate(tidy_data$count, by=list(airline=tidy_data$airline), FUN=sum)
colnames(total_flights) <- c("airline", "count") # name columns in resulting df
total_flights 

# Sum the total number of delayed flights for each airline using dplyr filter()
# Alaska delayed flights:
d_alaska <- filter(tidy_data, airline == "Alaska", status == "delayed")
d_alaska <- sum(d_alaska$count)
d_alaska

# AMWest delayed flights:
d_AMWest <- filter(tidy_data, airline == "AMWest", status == "delayed")
d_AMWest <- sum(d_AMWest$count)
d_AMWest

# Calculate the percentage of delayed flights for each airline:
p_d_alaska <- d_alaska/total_flights$count[1] # percentage of delays with Alaska
p_d_alaska
p_d_AMWest <- d_AMWest/total_flights$count[2] # percentage of delays with AMWest
p_d_AMWest

# Find difference between percentage of delays among airlines using absolute value:
abs(p_d_AMWest - p_d_alaska)

```
