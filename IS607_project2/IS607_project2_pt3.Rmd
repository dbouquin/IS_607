Part 3 of my additional practice with data clean-up and transformations using `tidyr` and `dplyr`. CRAN documentation available for `tidyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) and `dplr` documentation can be found [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

```{r, message=FALSE}

This chart lists digital ad revenue by billion(s) of US dollars available via the [Pew Research Center](http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/digital-u-s-display-advertising-by-company/):

1. Create a CSV file that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations:
```{r}
year <- c('2009','2010','2011','2012','2013')
google <- c('0.36','0.86','1.67','2.26','2.99')
facebook <- c('0.56','1.21','1.73','2.18','3.17')
yahoo <- c('1.26','1.43','1.36','1.35','1.27') 
microsoft <- c('0.37','0.51','0.60','0.90','0.79')
aol <- c('0.51','0.47','0.53','0.70','0.73')
ad_data <- data.frame(year,google,facebook,yahoo,microsoft,aol)
ad_data
#Write the CSV
write.csv(ad_data, "ad_data.csv")
```
2. Read the information from your CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.  
```{r}
ad <- read.csv("ad_data.csv")
ad
```
Restructure the dataset
```{r}
colnames(ad)
# Remove X column automatically created by csv import
ad <- ad[,2:6]
ad
# Convert the dataframe to a long format using gather()
tidy_ad <- ad %>% gather(company, ad_rev, -year)
# Arrange the data by year
tidy_ad <- arrange(tidy_ad, year)
# Check the new structure
str(tidy_ad)
tidy_ad
```
3. For analysis: total revenue by year and company, average revenue by year and company.
```{r}
# Check out the data graphically first to see any general trends in the data
qplot(year, ad_rev, data = tidy_ad, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = lm,  facets =  . ~ company)

# Calculate the total revenue by company
# This can be done using ddply()
ddply(tidy_ad, .(company), summarise, sum = sum(ad_rev))
# or tapply()
tapply(tidy_ad$ad_rev, tidy_ad$company, FUN=sum)

# Calculate the total revenue by year -- this can be done very similarly to the calculation by company
ddply(tidy_ad, .(year), summarise, sum = sum(ad_rev))
# or tapply()
tapply(tidy_ad$ad_rev, tidy_ad$year, FUN=sum)

# Calculate the average revenue by company and year -- also very similar to the last two calculations
# Average by company using ddply()
ddply(tidy_ad, .(company), summarise, avg = mean(ad_rev))
# or tapply()
tapply(tidy_ad$ad_rev, tidy_ad$company, FUN=mean)
# Average by year using ddply()
ddply(tidy_ad, .(year), summarise, avg = mean(ad_rev))
# or tapply()
tapply(tidy_ad$ad_rev, tidy_ad$year, FUN=mean)
```
To look a further we can check to see what year each company had their highest and lowest revenue by year
```{r}
# Company max revenue
max_rev <- tidy_ad %>% group_by(company) %>% slice(which.max(ad_rev))
max_rev

# Company min revenue
min_rev <- tidy_ad %>% group_by(company) %>% slice(which.min(ad_rev))
min_rev
```
