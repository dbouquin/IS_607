Part 3 of my additional practice with data clean-up and transformations using `tidyr` and `dplyr`. CRAN documentation available for `tidyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) and `dplr` documentation can be found [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).
