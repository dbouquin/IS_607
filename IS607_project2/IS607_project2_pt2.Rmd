Part 2 of my additional practice with data clean-up and transformations using `tidyr` and `dplyr`. CRAN documentation available for `tidyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) and `dplr` documentation can be found [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

This chart presents various details regarding living former Presidents of the United States:

1. Create a CSV file that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations:
```{r}
# CSV file was created in OpenOffice to quickly match the source chart very closely
# This could also be done using the data.frame() and write.csv() functions.
```
2. Read the information from your CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.  
```{r}
presidents <- read.csv("presidents.csv")
presidents
```
Restructure the dataset
```{r}
colnames(presidents)
# Split the Term_of_Office column into two separate columns
presidents$Start_Term <- lapply(strsplit(as.character(presidents$Term_of_Office), "\\-"), "[", 2)
presidents$End_Term <- lapply(strsplit(as.character(presidents$Term_of_Office), "\\-"), "[", 1)

# Drop the old column
presidents <- subset(presidents, select = c(President,DOB,Start_Term,End_Term))
presidents

# Pull the presidents' age out of the DOB column and create a new Age column
presidents$Age <- lapply(strsplit(as.character(presidents$DOB), "\\("), "[", 2)
ages <-  unlist(str_extract_all(presidents$Age, "[[:digit:]]{1,}"))
presidents$Age <- ages
presidents

# Drop old DOB column as we will not be using it from here forward
presidents <- subset(presidents, select = c(President,Start_Term,End_Term,Age))
presidents
```
3. For analysis: 
  * Give a list of presidents who had one term in office (4 years) and presidents who had two terms in office (8 years)
  * Which president is the oldest?
  * What is the average age of all presidents?
```{r}
# Give a list of presidents who had one term in office (4 years) and presidents who had two terms in office (8 years)

# Convert term columns to numeric values
presidents$Start_Term <- as.numeric(presidents$Start_Term)
presidents$End_Term <- as.numeric(presidents$End_Term)

# Add a column to indicate number of years in office (Just to make final result more clear)
presidents$Yrs_Office <- abs(presidents$Start_Term-presidents$End_Term)

# Create a table of presidents with two terms 
terms_2 <- presidents %>% filter(abs(presidents$Start_Term-presidents$End_Term) > 4)
terms_2
# Create a table of presidents with one term 
terms_1 <- presidents %>% filter(abs(presidents$Start_Term-presidents$End_Term) < 5)
terms_1

# Which president is the oldest?

# Convert age column to numeric
presidents$Age <- as.numeric(presidents$Age)
max_age <- presidents %>% slice(which.max(Age))
max_age

# Find the average age of all presidents
av_age_pres <- mean(presidents$Age)
av_age_pres
```
