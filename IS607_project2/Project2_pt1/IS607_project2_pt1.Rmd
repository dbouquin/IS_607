Additional practice with data clean-up and transformations using `tidyr` and `dplyr`. CRAN documentation available for `tidyr` is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) and `dplr` documentation can be found [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html).

This chart describes past Popes' favorability ratings over time:

1. Create a CSV file that includes all of the information above. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations:

```{r}
# Create a dataframe
pope <- c(rep('Francis', 2), rep('Benedict_XVI', 5), rep('JohnPaul_II',5))
end_date <- as.Date(c("2014-02-09", "2013-04-14", "2010-03-28", "2008-04-20", "2007-06-03", "2005-12-18","2005-05-01","2005-02-27", "2003-10-08", "2002-05-01", "1998-12-29", "1993-08-10")) # Used end date of surveys for favorability rating
p_favorable <- c(76,58,40,63,52,50,55,78,73,61,86,64)
p_unfavorable <- c(9,10,35,15,16,11,12,11,17,26,8,15)
p_no_op = c(16,31,25,22,32,39,33,11,10,13,6,21)

pope_data <- data.frame(pope, end_date, p_favorable, p_unfavorable, p_no_op)

# Write the dataframe to a CSV in current working directory
write.csv(pope_data, "pope_data.csv")

```

2. Read the information from your CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.  

```{r}
# Read the CSV file into R
popes <- read.csv("pope_data.csv")

# Remove auto-generated indicator column from dataset
popes <- popes[,2:5]

# Convert the dates column back to date format
popes$end_date <- as.Date(popes$end_date)

# Check the structure
str(popes)

```
Restructure the dataset
```{r}
# Create a column indicating favorability with two levels and another column with the   value

# Change the colnames so transformation better populates the new structure
colnames(popes) <- c("pope", "date", "favorable", "unfavorable")

tidy_popes <- popes %>%
  gather(favorability, percentage, -pope, -date) # Convert the data into a long format using gather() from tidyr package

str(tidy_popes) 

tidy_popes
```

3. For analysis: find the net favorables (favorable - unfavorable) and awareness (fav + unfav) for each pope over their full tenure.

```{r}
f_popes <- filter(tidy_popes, favorability == "favorable")
u_popes <- filter(tidy_popes, favorability == "unfavorable")

# Create a table to contain all Popes with their net favorability by date
net_f_popes <- abs(f_popes$percentage - u_popes$percentage)
n_popes <- f_popes[,1:2]
n_popes <- cbind(n_popes, net_f_popes)

# Rename the columns to make it cleaner
colnames(n_popes) <- c("Pope", "Survey_Date", "Net_Favorability")
n_popes 

# Check out when each Pope was least favorable
min_net <- n_popes %>% group_by(Pope) %>% slice(which.min(Net_Favorability))
min_net

# Check out when each Pope was most favorable
max_net <- n_popes %>% group_by(Pope) %>% slice(which.max(Net_Favorability))
max_net

# Plot to compare Pope's net favorability over time
qplot(Survey_Date, Net_Favorability, data = n_popes, stat="identity", geom = "histogram", fill = Pope, binwidth = 500, color = Pope)

# Create a table to contain all Popes with their awareness by date
aware_popes <- (f_popes$percentage + u_popes$percentage)
a_popes <- f_popes[,1:2]
a_popes <- cbind(a_popes, aware_popes)

# Rename the columns to make it cleaner
colnames(a_popes) <- c("Pope", "Survey_Date", "Percent_Awareness")
a_popes

# Plot to compare Pope's percent awareness over time
qplot(Survey_Date, Percent_Awareness, data = a_popes, stat="identity", geom = "histogram", fill = Pope, binwidth = 500, color = Pope)

# Check out when each Pope had the least general awareness
min_aware <- a_popes %>% group_by(Pope) %>% slice(which.min(Percent_Awareness))
min_aware

# Check out when each Pope had the most general awareness
max_aware <- a_popes %>% group_by(Pope) %>% slice(which.max(Percent_Awareness))
max_aware
```
